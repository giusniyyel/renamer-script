# Renamer file

Renamer file is a script to change the name of a file to a different one using a list of folios or codes.

## Why?
I personally used it to change the name of the certificates of participation, so I can be able to have all files with a folio name.

## How to use
- Clone the repository.
- Put all your files in **certs/** folder
- Then add all folios line by line in **folios.txt**.
- Finally use the terminal to run the script.

```bash
# Run the script.
python renamer.py
```

And that's it! ü•≥
